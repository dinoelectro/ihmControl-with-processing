# ihmControl-with-processing
buttons, toogle buttons, sliders, selectors clases with processing


Hello, this time I want to contribute with a set of classes that I have programmed using processing.

* button
* roundButton
* toogleButton
* slider
* selector

To work with them you must first indicate the position, width, height, color, text color, text when it is false, text when it is true

use show () method inside draw () to show control

use the getValue () method to know the current value of the control

I receive suggestions to improve this set of classes, greetings!
